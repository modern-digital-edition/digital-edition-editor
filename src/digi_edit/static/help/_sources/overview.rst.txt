Overview
========

The Digital Edition Editor provides an interface for editing TEI (and other) texts of a Digital Edition online.

The core concept of the Digital Edition Editor is the "Task". A Task combines one or more changes that belong together.
When a new Task is created, a complete copy of the edition's content is made and any changes that are later made in the
Task are saved in that copy. After all desired changes in a Task have been completed, the changes can be integrated
back into the edition's content.

.. important::

    As each Task has its own copy of the conent, it is possible to work on multiple Tasks at the same time. The only
    thing that should be avoided is to work on the same file in multiple Tasks. Editing the same file in multiple
    Tasks can lead to situations where manual work is needed to integrate the changes, thus it should be avoided.

The editor works with the latest two versions of all modern browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge,
Apple Safari). Older browser can unfortunately not be supported.
