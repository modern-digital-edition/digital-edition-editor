Working on a Task
=================

You can only work on an active Task. Integrated and Delete Tasks are shown so that changes can be traces, but for
neither type is it possible to make any further changes or to make them active again.

To work on a Task, in the Task list ensure that the "Active Tasks" checkbox is selected in the Task list
(:doc:`see here <filter_tasks>`). Then click on the name of the Task that you wish to work on. This shows the
Task page, where you can then :doc:`work on files <work_on_file>`.
