Deleting a Task
===============

To delete a Task, either click on the |delete| icon in the Task list or on the Task page. You will be asked to confirm
that you wish to delete the Task, as this process cannot be undone. If you confirm the deletion, then the Task will
immediately be deleted, its copy will be deleted, and the backend will also be synchronised immediately.
