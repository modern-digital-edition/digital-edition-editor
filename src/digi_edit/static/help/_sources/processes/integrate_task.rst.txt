Integrating a Task
==================

After all the changes have been made in a Task, it is time to integrate the Task's changes into the main copy of the
edition. To start the process, go to the :doc:`Task page <work_on_task>`. There, at the top of the page click on the
request integration link |source-pull|. A popup will appear to indicate that the integration process is starting and
after a few seconds the icon will update (|cancel-source-pull|) to indicate that the integration process has started.

Depending on how the storage backend is configured, the integration might happen automatically after the integration
is started. Alternatively there may be a review process, after which the changes are integrated. When the changes
have been integrated on the backend, the Task page will automatically be updated. Alternatively, if required you can
:doc:`cancel the integration <cancel_integration>`.
