Updating a Task
===============

When other Tasks are integrated into the main copy, those changes need to be added to the other Tasks. Only if the
Task includes all the changes from the primary copy can it be integrated. You can see that a Task requires updating,
if the update icon (|update|) is shown, both in the Task list and the individual Task page.

To update the Task to the latest changes, click on the update icon (|update|). You can do this while you are still
working on the Task, but you can also do that after you have requested the integration.
