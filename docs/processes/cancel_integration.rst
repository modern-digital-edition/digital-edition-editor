Cancel Task integration
=======================

If you wish to cancel a Task integration, click on the cancel integration icon (|cancel-source-pull|). This will
cancel the integration on the backend, and after a few seconds the icon will update to indicate that there is no
integration requested (|source-pull|). After making any additional changes you wish to make, you can then
:doc:`request the integration again <integrate_task>`.
