Creating a new Task
===================

To create a new Task you need to first navigate to the Task list. This list is automatically shown after logging in,
but you can also navigate to the list by clicking on the "Edition" link in the top-left corner of the application.

In the top-right corner of the Task list, is a link "Add a Task". Clicking on this opens a new popup box with the
title "Add a Task" and a single input box "Task Name". Enter the new Task's name into this input box. The name should
describe the changes you intend to make in the Task, as the Task's name will later be stored in the history.

After entering the Task's name, click on the "Add a Task" button. This will start the process of creating a new copy
of the content for the Task. After the Task has been created, you will automatically be taken to the Task page,
where you can :doc:`work on the files <work_on_file>` you wish to edit.

If you decide that you don't want to create a new Task, you can also click on the "Don't add" link.
