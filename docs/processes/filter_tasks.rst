Filtering Tasks
===============

The number of Tasks can become relatively long. To simplify the navigation, the list of Tasks can be filtered by the
Tasks' status. By default the list only shows the currently active Tasks. You can change this using the checkboxes
at the top of the list. Ensure those checkboxes are selected, that you wish to see (from the choice of Active Tasks,
Integrated Tasks, and Deleted Tasks). The list of tasks is immediately updated.

Additionally the list of Tasks is sorted by the date of the last change. When there are more than ten Tasks in the
list, you can use the "Next Page" and "Previous Page" links at the bottom of the Task list to navigate through the
list.
