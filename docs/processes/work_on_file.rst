Working on a file
=================

To work on a file, first :doc:`open the Task <work_on_task>` within which you wish to work on the file. If you have not
previously worked on a file in this Task, then by default the "All Files" view is shown. This shows all the files that
can be edited, grouped by directory, and then sorted alphabetically.

If you have previously worked on a file in this Task, then by default the "Changed Files" view is shown. This shows
those files that have been modified, grouped by directory, and sorted alphabetically. You can switch back to the list
of all files by clicking on the "All Files" link at the top of the file list.

The list of all files is frequently very long. You can find the file you wish to edit by scrolling through it.
Alternatively you can enter a search term into the input box at the top of the list of all files. This will filter the
list of files to only show those where the filename includes the search term. The list is updated as soon as you type
something into the input box.

In either view you can edit a file by clicking on the filename. This opens the appropriate
:doc:`editor <../editor/index>`.
