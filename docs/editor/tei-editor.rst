TEI Editor
==========

The TEI Editor provides a modern interface for editing TEI files. The editor consists of a menubar across the top
and the editing interface below. The menubar always contains the "Save" button, which saves all changes. Next to
that there will one or more links for editing different sections of the TEI file. Depending on how each section
is configured, clicking on it will either load the interface for editing TEI text or editing TEI metadata.

TEI text editing
----------------

The TEI text editor consists of two parts. The main text editor, where you can make the changes to the text, and
the annotation sidebar on the right. The exact contents of the sidebar depends on the configuration. The TEI
Editor supports multiple text editor sections for each TEI file.

TEI metadata editing
--------------------

The TEI metadata editor contains a number of metadata sections (which ones depends on how the system is configured),
with each section introduced by a header and then containing one or more input boxes.

For some parts of the metadata it is possible to provide multiple values. You can recognise these because they have
a |plus| icon. Clicking on that icon adds an additional value. To delete a value, click on the |minus| icon. You
can also re-order the values using the |chevron-up| and |chevron-down| icons.
